## What Is CCPA?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is California’s privacy law aimed at enhancing consumer privacy rights for residents of California, United States. The law became fully enforceable on July 1st, 2020.

## Who Is Affected by CCPA?

Under the CCPA, businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumers' records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling your personal information (PI) must comply. All businesses must comply if they collect or sell Californians' personal information, whether they are located in California, a different state, or even a different country.

## Key Facts of CCPA

The following are the key facts of the CCPA:

### Own Your Personal Information

#### Right to Know What Personal Information Is Being Collected

As a consumer, you have the right to request the business that collects your personal information to disclose to you the categories of personal information that it has collected about you.

#### Right to Know Whether Personal Information Is Sold or Disclosed and to Whom

As a consumer, you have the right to request that the business that sells your personal information or discloses it for a business purpose, to disclose to you:

- The personal information that is sold to third parties and the identity of such third parties
- The personal information that is disclosed for a business purpose to third parties and the identity of such third parties

### Control Your Personal Information

If you do not want a corporation to sell your information, you can stop them by clicking the **do not sell my data** link.  The corporation cannot hide this in a privacy policy—they have to display it clearly at the bottom of any page where they collect your information. If you tell them not to sell your info, they cannot discriminate against you. This means they cannot charge you more, deny you access to services, or change the quality of the service you get.

### Secure Your Personal Information

A business that owns, licenses, or maintains personal information about a Californian resident needs to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information. The business needs to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

### Hold Big Corporations Accountable

Under the CCPA, only businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumer records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling your personal information must comply. Such businesses must comply if they collect or sell Californians' personal information, whether they are located in California, a different state, or even a different country.

### How Is Personal Information Defined Under the CCPA

The CCPA defines “personal information” as any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

The CCPA documentation provides specific examples of personal data. The list includes, but is not limited to, the following identifiers:

- Identifiers such as a real name, alias, address, email address, social security number, license number, passport number, or similar identifiers.
- Commercial information including property records, product purchases, and other consumer histories and tendencies.
- Biometric data such as fingerprints and facial recognition data.
- Internet or network activity data, such as IP addresses, browsing history, search history, and interactions with online sites or advertisements.

## MoEngage Compliance with CCPA

### Right to Know What Personal Information Is Being Collected

You can accomplish user data retrieval in several ways:

- The Get User API of MoEngage provides all collected data for the specified users. For more information, refer to [Get User API](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/19985864018836-Get-User-API).
- You can export user data from MoEngage. Navigate to the Segmentation module on the MoEngage dashboard and download the data as required. For more information, refer to [User Data Exports](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/205424326).
- You can also contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the Support team for a copy of all data we have for any user.

### Right to Know Whether Personal Information Is Sold or Disclosed and to Whom

We only send the information to the following third-party platforms if you have opted in for MoEngage email or SMS sending:

- Email Connector (Sendgrid or any other as per the client setup)
- SMS Connector or Service Provider (Gupshup or any other as per the client setup)

For more information on this, refer to [privacy policy](https://www.moengage.com/privacy-policy/).

### Right to Say No to the Sale or Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not sell personal information at all. If a user requests to opt-out of data processing, you can do so by following the SDK methods listed in our integration documents:

[Android](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043067671-Default-Android-SDK-) \| [iOS](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042512472-Default-iOS-SDK-) \| [Web](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042954831-Default-Web-SDK-)

### Data Deletion

You can delete the data of your users when required. To do this, we have hosted the GDPR/CCPA API that removes all personal data associated with specific users who have requested their data to be erased from MoEngage. For more information, refer to [GDPR/CCPA API](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405026835220-GDPR-CCPA-API).

The API accepts one of the following parameters as input:

- ID (required for logged-in users)
- Email
- Mobile Number
- GAID (required for anonymous users)
- IDFA (required for anonymous users)

Removing a user’s personal data erases their personal data from MoEngage. To maintain the integrity of campaign and application usage analytics, anonymous aggregated data is not modified when an end user is removed (for example, MoEngage does not decrement an app’s MAU numbers or Campaign Stats when an end user is deleted). However, this data is not connected in any way to the profile of the forgotten end user, ensuring that this anonymized and aggregated data cannot be tied back to any individual user.

After the API request is made to remove personal data for specific users, it takes a maximum of 7 days for completing this request. It may, however, take 60 days to remove this data from all our logs and backups. We need to maintain the data for 60 days to justify our processing of erasure requests of personal data related to every user.

## CCPA and GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all activities involved in the processing of personal data—including storing, accessing, and transferring data. The CCPA, however, only applies to the collection, sale, and disclosure of personal information for business purposes.

## What is an Attribution Window?

An attribution widow is the time period that is calculated since the user last engaged with a communication from the flow, that is, viewing a communication.

For a specific user trip in the flow, the attribution window starts when the customer gets engaged by an action campaign and ends when the defined attribution window gets over from the action campaign that the customer engaged with finally.

In the following example, **Track above goal** for is set as 36 hours. This is the attribution window for the flow.

![exit on conversion.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/25679820350740)

## How Does MoEngage Attribute Conversion to Flows?

By default MoEngage attributes users doing the defined goal event within the attribution window from the time the user saw the communication as "Conversions".

You can choose any event tracked in MoEngage as a conversion goal activity and set more than one conversion goal in a flow. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal. For example, if you want to track the number of customers who have purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent. Your conversion goal setup might look as it is shown in the previous image.

The flow conversions will be the share of the unique user entries that performed the conversion goal within the attribution window after viewing/engaging any of the Flow Action campaign messages during their flow trip. All conversions attributed to flows will be influenced by at least one of the Action campaigns of the flow, and all conversions of the Action campaigns will be attributed to flows.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Information**<br>When the **Exit on conversion** toggle is on, MoEngage forcefully exits users from the flow as soon as they convert with the primary conversion goal. The number of users who have been forcefully exited is also available at every stage. In the case shown in the following image, **4** users have been forcefully exited from the flow at the last stage because their primary conversion goal has been achieved and the **Exit on conversion** toggle was on.<br>![ExitConversionMetric.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9116934893460) |

## Examples

Assuming that the following flow is configured with the event "Product Purchased" as the conversion goal for the flow and the attribution window is set as 2 hours. The "Has Received push" condition is evaluated for 2 hours.

![7932B40B-BBB7-4A37-BD4D-C18B537F2F1C_1_201_a.jpeg](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/7519337691156)

### Scenario 1

The user enters the flow at 1:00 PM on Day D1, but the message is not delivered until 3:01 PM for some reason. Hence the user is sent the Push 2 campaign at 3:02 and then exits the flow by 3:03 PM. Eventually, both messages are delivered at 3:10 PM. The user purchases a product at 4:15 PM.

Now, both the Action campaign's conversion and conversion event will increase by 1 each. Also the Flow Converted Trips will increase by 1 and the flow conversions will increase by 1. This is because the attribution window for both the Push campaigns were until 5:10 PM and the user did the goal event within this period.

### Scenario 2

The user enters the flow at 1:00 PM on Day D1, but the message is not delivered till 3:01 PM for some reason. Hence the user is sent the Push 2 campaign at 3:02 and then exits the flow by 3:03 PM. Eventually, Push 1 and Push 2 are delivered at 3:10 PM and 4:00 PM respectively. The user purchases a product at 5:30 PM and 6:00 PM.

Now, the Conversion and Flow Converted Trips of Push 2 will increase by 1, while Push 1 Conversion will not be increased. This is because the user converted time is outside of the attribution window for Push 1, but is within the attribution window of Push 2. Flow Conversions and the conversion event metric of Push 2 will be incremented by 2 because the user did conversion event 2 times within the attribution window.

## Types of Attribution

There are three types of attributions for every conversion goal, and they are:

View throughClick throughIn session

**View through attribution** refers to the users whose conversions are attributed to their having completed the goal after having viewed a campaign such as Push, Email, SMS.

In the following image, there are **16** conversions that are attributed to the view through attribution type because out of the **17** users who have entered this flow, **16** have seen and converted.

![View_Through.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9144129429012)

**Click through attribution** refers to the users whose conversions are attributed to their having completed the goal after clicking on a campaign such as Push, Email, SMS.

When we select the filter type as "Click Through", the converted trip number changes from **16** to **3** because **3** people clicked the campaign and converted.

![Click_Through.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9144157608596)

**In session attribution** refers to the users whose conversions are attributed to their having completed the goal within 30 minutes after clicking a link in your communication.

In Session attribution is attributed to the conversions that happen during the session, and these can be shown in the following image. Since the **3** conversions have happened within 30 minutes, they are also attributed to 'in session'. Thus, the in-session attribution is also **3**.

### Content

The Beta tag around a product or feature indicates that the respective product or feature is not released to the public, but is an open or closed beta release.

# What is a Beta Release?

MoEngage does a beta release when the product feature is complete and all the development is done but the feature may have some bugs and performance issues. This release is mostly done for users who want to test the product, use it cautiously, and report bugs.

# What is a Closed or Open Beta Release?

When the product or feature in beta is exposed to all the customers, it is called an Open Beta Release. When the product or feature in beta is exposed only to a limited or closed group of customers, it is called a Closed Beta Release.

# What does a Beta Feature Mean for MoEngage Users?

If you are seeing any beta product or feature, you are among the users or clients who would have either requested the feature, or the Product team at MoEngage would have considered the product or feature relevant to you.

You must be cautious while using any beta feature because it might have some low-impact bugs that might have escaped testing (QA). It will be great if you report any bugs or performance issues that you face while using the product or features in beta. It will help MoEngage to improve your experience and deliver a bug-free product.

For further assistance, please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the Support team.

# Introduction

In today's competitive landscape, the ability to recommend products or services precisely tailored to the customers' needs and preferences based on their current browsing behavior is a powerful tool. Displaying recently-viewed products on a website is important for numerous advantageous reasons:

- **Recollection**: It helps users remember the products they have shown interest in. People may browse numerous items before making a purchasing decision, and may easily forget the products they previously viewed. A recently viewed section aids in jogging their memory.
- **Convenience**: It saves customers time because they don't need to search the whole website again to find a product they were previously interested in. It makes the customer journey more convenient.
- **Personalized User Experience**: Displaying recently-viewed products provides a personalized shopping experience. It shows that the platform is paying attention to the user's interests.
- **Increase in Sales**: Products recently viewed, but not purchased immediately, can indicate a hesitance or indecision on the customer's part. Reminding them of their incomplete purchase may prompt a decision, leading to an increase in sales. This is often referred to as reducing 'view abandonment'.
- **Improved Customer Retention**: By tailoring the shopping experience to user's tastes and preferences, businesses can boost customer satisfaction and increase the likelihood of return visits and customer loyalty.

In this article, we will see how you can achieve the same using the powerful combination of MoEngage Personalize and Recommendations.

# Expected Result

Users will see the personalized recommendations with product grids based on what they viewed recently.

| library\_add\_check | **Prerequisites**<br>- Events to track user activity on a website through MoEngage Web SDK must already be configured. To understand how to track events, refer to the [Developer Guide](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us).<br>  <br>- Integration of the MoEngage Personalize SDK with your website to create a personalized web experience. For more information, refer to the [Personalize SDK Integration Guide](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10645116433812-Web-Personalization-V2).<br>- A catalog listing all your products must be uploaded on the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer to [Catalogs](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/17456587985428).<br>  <br>- Mapping of the user actions to standard MoEngage actions on the MoEngage dashboard. This mapping helps us in understanding the action and thus run our recommendation models and in querying models to create an expected output. For more information, refer to [Map User Actions Settings](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/17459183026196). |

# Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the users action:

1. Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select **Content** \> **Recommendations** from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to [Creating User Action Recommendations](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/17558854011924#h_01HDNVE5AGE3QZ03RNCQ5DMDPW).
2. At the top right corner, click **\+ Create recommendation**. It takes you to the first step "Select recommendation model".

![2.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29107709933076)
3. In the **Filter by user action and item attributes** section, select the **User Actions** model.

2. You can personalize either a single web page or multiple web pages.

**Note**: In case of multiple web pages, the elements to be personalized must be present on every page matching the web page filtering criteria. If the element is not present, the personalization will not be shown to the user.
3. In the **URL** field, enter the URL on which we will do the setup and click **Verify SDK setup**. This will check if the SDK is installed in the pages.

When you map information, from the **Choose your recommendation** drop-down list, select the recommendation "Recently Viewed Products" you created [above](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/28066179709716-How-to-Show-Recently-Viewed-Products-on-Website#h_01HSJQ983JG58NVT0FTB0M778V).
9. Click **Next** to move to the third step "Schedule and goals" where you can define the schedule and goal of your experience.

## Step 3: Schedule and Goals

1. In the **Send experience** section, select **Active continuously** and define when to start and end this experience.

![image-20240120-130725.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/28261375700116)
2. In the **Conversion goals** section, define the conversion goal based on your requirements.
3. Under **Delivery controls**, from the **Experience Priority** drop-down, select a priority. For more information, refer to [Create Experience](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/11621615057300).
4. Click **Publish**.

# Conclusion

Whenever the visitors fulfil the criteria specified for the target audience, they would see the product grid widget on the web page(s) after they perform the custom event. For example, product viewed, product added to cart, or product wishlisted.

Recently Viewed products displayed on the home page:

### Content

Growth teams need to perform a lot of data analysis for their daily operations. For this analysis, they need the correct data access at the right time. MoEngage Open Analytics enables growth teams to access the latest data on the MoEngage platform in real time directly from the data storage. MoEngage allows customers to directly query the data warehouse and get desired data.

## Capabilities of Open Analytics

MoEngage open analytics can help with  -

1. Read and Query data using SQL queries through a console or Programmatically via API
2. Visualize the data on the Open Analytics console through in-build visualization methods available

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | MoEngage open analytics is not suitable for data exports. For data export, please use [MoEngage Streams](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4952761690644-MoEngage-Streams) or [S3 exports](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/8098260902548). |

## Enable Open Analytics

MoEngage requires 2 sets of information to enable open analytics -

1. Email ids of users
2. The static IP address. (This can be your VPN IP as well. Make sure you provide the static IP, IPs provided by your network provider will not work)

## Data Categories

All data received at the MoEngage system can be categorized into 3 kinds –

1. Device data
2. User Data
3. Event data

The data is collected using the SDK and S2S events and processed and stored with events.

## Data Schema

MoEngage processes and stores all the device attributes and event attributes in separate event tables for each event.

Table Name - account\_name.event\_name

| attribute 1 | attribute 2 | attribute 3 | -- | attribute n-1 | attribute n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

The time window for analysis can be selected using the attribute - **day.** This partition time works for all tables. **Must always use this in your queries to limit the costs.** For Example

SQL

LightDark

content\_copyCopy Code

task\_altCode Copied

```sql



SELECT server_time, COUNT(server_time) as metric

FROM

"account_name"."moe_app_opened_828"

WHERE

day >= '2022-01-01'

GROUP BY 1

ORDER BY 1
```

Event Tables can be joined using common keys/attributes such as - **user\_id**

SQL

LightDark

content\_copyCopy Code

task\_altCode Copied

```sql



SELECT user1

FROM

(SELECT user_id AS user1 FROM "account_name"."uptete_spa") table1

INNER JOIN

(SELECT user_id AS user2 FROM "account_name"."moe_user_merge") table2

ON table1.user1 = table2.user2
```

### Event & Attribute Naming Convention

Event names have structure as ‘EventName\_XXX’, for example - moe\_app\_opened\_828

Event Attribute names have a structure as ‘Datatype\_AttributeName\_XXX’, for example - string\_activity\_name\_880

### User Attributes

User attributes are stored in the user table, and the table refreshes one time every day.

Table Name - **users\_base\_table** **Column for MoEngage generated User Id - user\_id**

| attribute 1 | attribute 2 | attribute ... | attribute n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Important Attribute Information

(These attributes should be present in all of the events)

1. **day**\- Time-window for analysis can be selected using this attribute **.** This partition time works for all tables. This should be considered as the date attribute for Tables.
2. **server\_time** \- UTC at which events reach MoEngage servers.
3. **user\_id** \- This is a MoEngage-generated User Id.
4. **string\_uid\_125** \- This is the User Id generated by your App/Site.
5. **original\_event\_name** \- Event Name
6. **user\_time** \- Event time in the local time zone

## Open analytics Usage Best Practices

1. Use **day** in your queries to optimize query performance. Otherwise, MoEngage will scan the entire table, and scanning costs will be higher.
2. MoEngage works on a columnar database, so you can use only the columns ( attributes ) you need for analysis. If unnecessary columns are used, cost increases, and query performance decreases.
3. To optimize queries, refer to [best practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-10-performance-tuning-tips-for-amazon-athena/).

4. A general guide to writing Athena SQL queries -

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-athena-tables.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-athena-tables.html)

## Programmatic Access to Data

To read data using python or java code, Open Analytics makes APIs available to generate the report utilizing existing queries. For more information, refer to [using APIs](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/integrations-and-api/api).

## Sample Queries

1. [Key Metrics Queries](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048049252-Key-Metrics-Queries-for-Open-Analytics)
2. [Reachability Queries](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047789072-Reachability-Queries-for-Open-Analytics)

For further assistance, please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the Support team.

### Content

MoEngage Inform facilitates a unified messaging infrastructure across multiple channels using a single API to build and manage transactional alerts.

# Transactional Alerts

Any time-sensitive transactional content that a brand sends to its customers is a Transactional Alert. The following are examples of transactional alerts:

- Order/Booking/Purchase confirmations and pertinent updates
- Shipping/Delivery confirmations and applicable updates
- Security and account alerts for fraud prevention
- Password resets
- OTP (one-time password)/ Verification Code
- User invitations and shares
- User inaction related to previous transactions

# Legacy Transactional Messaging Structure

A notification is sent across multiple channels simultaneously, employing a multi-channel transactional messaging structure. To implement such a structure, you would need to:

1. Build APIs for multiple channels
2. Maintain these APIs across all channels and vendors
3. Maintain vendor contracts

![mceclip0.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/10730362809364)

## Legacy Structure - Drawbacks

The current Transactional Messaging infrastructure has the following drawbacks:

- Lack of requisite developer bandwidth - Heavy reliance on engineering bandwidth to make even the slightest changes
- Lack of visibility on alert (message) performance - Absence of a centralized dashboard to manage alerts, content templates, and delivery partners
- Lack of control over the content - Product, content, and marketing teams have limited control over the content and alert logic because of the wait for engineering bandwidth.

# MoEngage Inform 

MoEngage Inform enables brands to build and manage transactional alerts across channels through One API. You can build, iterate quickly, and scale effortlessly.

# ![mceclip2.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/10730373541396)

## Advantages

With MoEngage Inform, brands can utilize a single dashboard without the need to alter or deploy code. It helps to:

- send personalized Transactional Messages on multiple channels
- add new channels
- build and edit templates in minutes
- switch seamlessly between messaging vendors
- debug in real time easily with end-to-end logs
- collaborate with the product, growth, and marketing teams to analyze and optimize alerts

![create alert.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/40868794853268)

You can create alertss using the following steps:

- [Step 1: Alert Details](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10673016675732-Create-Alert#h_01GPM9FDH2XZX3BEHJ1KHDWP1B): Add details to describe the alert.
- [Step 2: Content](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10673016675732-Create-Alert#h_01GPM9FSNSQDDA0B6K1M3JR7QM): Design the message for all selected channels.
- [Step 3: Publish](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10673016675732-Create-Alert#h_01GPM9G0CBX1VJ41C6DZF68S92): Test and publish the alert.

## Alert Details

In the **Alert Details** section, define the details of your alert using the following fields:

1. **Specify an Alert Name**: This field is used to identify the Alert and is mandatory. This field can contain a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 256 characters.
2. **Reference ID**: This field is used to identify the Alert using your Reference Name and can be used to identify the alert as an alternative to Alert ID. This field is not mandatory and can contain a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 256 characters.
3. **Describe the alert in the Alert Description**: This field is used to describe the purpose of the Alert:
   - **Tags** Select the predefined tags or add new tags to identify your alert. This dropdown contains tags that can add context to your alerts. These tags can describe the purpose of the alert, such as transaction OTP, order confirmation, and so on. Once added, tags allow you to filter Alerts in the All Alerts section. For more information about, refer to [Tags](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058057412).
   - **Teams** This field is used to select the Team associated with this Alert from the list of Teams. This field is enabled during Alert creation if your organization has “Teams” enabled. For more information, refer to [Teams in MoEngage](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028586211)
4. **Configure relevant channels**

   - SMS
   - Email
   - Push
   - WhatsApp

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Note**<br>These channels need to be configured before Alert Creation. Refer to [SMS Settings,](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408413593492-Overview) [Email Settings,](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059172811) [Push Settings](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/7689492811796-iOS-Push) and [WhatsApp settings](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4960734358932-Configure-WhatsApp) for configuring these channels. |

Choose the channels on which the Alert has to be sent, and the content for the chosen channels can be defined in the next step (content creation) of Alert creation. It is mandatory to select at least one channel for Alert Creation. If more than one channel is selected, the content for both of them must be defined.

5. **Set Channel Sending Order(Channel Fallback)**
If you choose more than one channel for Alert creation, you can configure whether the alerts should be sent in parallell or sequential. When more than one channel is selected, the following channel-sending order options are available:
1. **In parallel**: You can send alerts in parallell for only two channels.
2. **In sequence (on Sender Failure)**: You can specify the Default, first, and second Fallback channels to be used when there is a failure to send using the Default channel. Channel fallbacks are employed in the case where:


      - There is an error in the request payload for the default or first fallback channel. For example, when the recipient details or personalization attributes are not present in the request payload for the channel
      - When the request returns a 4xx or 5xx error when submitted to the vendor for the particular channel. For example, invalid authorization details would result in a 401 error returned by the vendor, and this would be considered a _failed-to-send_ error for the channel for which the delivery is being attempted.
      - Vendor rejections for requests for channels would also lead to MoEngage using the fallback channel to send the Alert. For example, if your credit limit is exhausted for the vendor account, the vendor could reject the request to send the Alert. In such a case, MoEngage would use the fallback configured to send the Alert.

For example, if the default channel were Push, the first fallback WhatsApp and the second fallback SMS and an Alert would be sent to a customer. If there is a failure in sending the Push (say if the user does not have an active Push token), then the Alert will be attempted using the WhatsApp channel. If there is an issue in sending using the WhatsApp channel, the SMS channel will be tried next.

![Whatsapp in inform 2.gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/34275214309780)

3. **In sequence (on Delivery Failure)**: You can specify the Default channel and a Fallback channel to be used when the Default channel fails to deliver the alert. You can use the Delivery fallback configuration to set up the wait time window before switching the channel. In the Try successful delivery for \_ before making a new attempt field, enter a value between 1 minute to 60 minutes. If the default channel fails to deliver the alert, the system makes a new attempt to deliver the alert using the Fallback channel after the wait time is over.

      For example, if the default channel is SMS and the fallback channel is Email and the wait time window is 5 minutes. If there is a failure in delivering the SMS, then the Alert will be attempted using the Email channel after 5 minutes.

4. Check the boxes of the platform that you want to target:
   - **Android**
   - **iOS**
   - **Web**
   - **TV (Early Access)**


     |     |     |
     | --- | --- |
     |  | **Early Access**<br>- You can only create [Self Handled Cards](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/18392458870676-Self-Handled-Cards#get-cards-info-0-5) for TV.<br>- You cannot select TV as a platform along with Android, iOS, or Web. You must only select **TV** to proceed further. |
5. Based on how you want the campaign to be triggered, you can select one of the following criteria:



One TimeEvent TriggeredPeriodic





A **One Time** Card Campaign enables you to send the Card to a specific user segment only once as soon as possible or at a scheduled date and time. ![card one time.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/20696979329812)

You can check the **Allow Future Qualifiers** box if you want users to access the Cards after the scheduled time. For example, if the Card was scheduled to go live at 10 am on a particular day, users who visit your application at 11 am or anytime after the scheduled time will also be eligible for the Card. For more information, see [Allow Future Qualifiers](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045074752-Create-a-Card-Campaign#Allow-Future-Qualifiers).







An **Event Triggered** Campaign enables you to send the Card to a specific user segment when the specified trigger condition is met. For example, you can send a Card to users who updated your application using any platform. In this case, the condition would be set as _App Update_ which when triggered would deliver the Card to the user.





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Information**<br>With Event Triggered Cards, the latest triggered card overwrites the existing card from the previous trigger from the same campaign (if any). Thus, only the latest card from that campaign would be visible to the user. |





![card on event trigger.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/20696979330836)



Follow the steps below to define the trigger condition under **Select** **Trigger Condition**:



- In the **IF** section,

1. In the **Select an event** drop-down list, select the user action that needs to be performed to trigger the campaign. This is the primary filter condition.
2. Click **\+ Attribute** to add attributes to the filter. (This is optional)
3. Click **\+ ADD FILTER** to add another filter with the primary filter. (This is optional)
- In the **THEN** section,

1. Select **Immediately** to send the campaign within the next 30 to 60 seconds.
2. Select **With Delay** and provide the following details to define the timeframe and the event criteria to be fulfilled to send the campaign:


     1. Enter the number and select the minutes, hours, or days.
     2. Select Before or After the time.
     3. Select the action to be performed by the user in the drop-down list for the if condition. The user must perform the actions added within the time specified in the delay criteria after performing the first action.

![card trigger condition.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/20698058602004)

**Periodic** Campaigns help you target a specific user segment recurrently. For example, you can send a Card to encourage users to update your application once every month. ![card periodic.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/20696979332756)

### Allow Future Qualifiers (recommended)

**Allow Future Qualifiers** checkbox in One-time campaigns, allows the campaign to include users who qualify the segment criteria at any time in the future.

The differences between a one-time campaign with and without the Allow Future Qualifiers are displayed in the following table:

|  | Without Allow Future Qualifiers | With Allow Future Qualifiers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use case** | For campaigns that have a non-changing set of recipients who already have a device (app/website) at the time of sending. | If you need to display cards to new or anonymous users who may enter the segment after launch or may add a device after launch |
| **Audience** | Cards are sent only to those users who have an active device tracked in MoEngage and are part of the segment at the time of sending the campaign. If a user who qualifies for the segment adds a device later, they will not see the Card. | Cards are sent to users who qualify for the segment condition at the time it is sent or who qualify for the segment condition at any time in the future. <br>- For "All users" campaigns, the Cards are sent even to anonymous users in their first session.<br>- For segmented campaigns, future users who qualify the segment criteria—even though they were not part of the segment at the time of sending the campaign—will see the Card from the second session onwards.<br>_**Note:** For such campaigns, if a user receives a Card as an anonymous user, but is part of the exclusion criteria after logging in to the app, the user will still see the Card that was shown when they were anonymous._ |
| **Analytics** | MoEngage considers the sent count based on the number of users with active devices targeted at the time of sending the campaign. | MoEngage considers the sent count based on the number of unique users receiving the Card campaign when it is delivered to them. |
| **Response time** | Because there is no evaluation at the time of delivery, these campaigns are delivered to the app quickly on app open/fetch. | Because there is an eligibility evaluation at the time of delivery, it may take an additional 1 second to fetch Cards if the user has any Card with the **Allow Future Qualifiers** flag set to True. |
| **Campaign expiry** | The campaign expiry time starts from the time the campaign is delivered to the logged-in user. | If a user receives the Card anonymously, the campaign expiry time starts from the anonymous delivery time. <br>If a user receives the Card after logging in to the app, the campaign expiry time starts from the time the campaign is delivered to the logged-in user. |
| **Global Control Group** | Optional | Users in the Global control group are not excluded from campaigns with Allow future qualifiers. |

6. Select **All users** in the **Select Audience** section to send the campaign to all the app users.

![all users.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/20698050317588)


If you want to send the campaign to selected users, you can choose the **Filter users by** option. This option provides you with four different methods to segment the target audience for the particular campaign as follows:

## Create view

Once you've decided your target users, you can define the content of the Card campaign to be sent by following the steps below:

1. Click the dropdown and select your Card category.

![mceclip2.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360061058652)
   - The dropdown displays the **Card categories** that you've configured for the Inbox during the SDK integration process. MoEngage recommends organizing content into up to **five** tabs, including the **All** tab, for an optimal user experience. For example, Announcements, Promotions, Updates, Others, and All. You can customize the number of tabs based on your specific needs.
   - The **All** category, by default, displays all your cards set up in the **All** page in an aggregated format. This is not a required selection in the Category dropdown.
2. Click the dropdown and select the required template.

![TemplateType.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9797527473684)

MoEngage provides two types of Card templates as follows:

   - **Basic Card** \- You can use the basic template to send a simple message that focuses primarily on text, such as informing customers about an offer that ends next weekend and includes information like "50% off on summer apparel" along with your logo for easy brand memory.
   - **Illustration Card** \- You can use the illustration template if you want your message to be richer and more focused on an image or gif that provides further information about the upcoming deal coupled with concise text.
3. Manage the look and feel of your Card by configuring the various components of the Card as follows:
   - **Select background color**


     To make your message more appealing, you might want to add a background color to your notification. You can either choose a color from the color picker or add a hex code.

     ![Cards_Msg_BGColor.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9972278618004)

   - **Header**
     The Header represents the title or heading of the Card that you want to communicate with your users.
     - The text limit for the Header is 30 characters.
     - You can also use emojis in all the text fields.

       ![mceclip21.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360060844272)
   - **Message**


     The Message represents a brief description of the Card that you want to deliver to your users.
     - The text limit for the Message is 115 characters. Depending on the width of the device, you can add up to three lines of text. On larger devices, more text will be visible, while on smaller ones, less text.

       ![mceclip22.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360060844372)
     - You can apply some basic formatting to your Message by changing it's style and color.
     - You can also use emojis in all the message fields. Use websites like [Getemoji](http://getemoji.com/) to copy and directly paste the emoji, anywhere in your header or message.
   - **Image**


     Images enhance the visual appeal of your Cards. You can add images using the following methods:


     - **Enter Media URL**: Provide the URL of an image hosted on a third-party application.
     - **Upload Image**: Upload an image or GIF from your local system. Landscape mode is recommended for the best display.

2. Under the **Display Controls** section, manage your Card display by configuring the following conditions:




Card ExpiryThe Period to Display the Card Maximum Time to Show the CardPin Card to the top





You can configure the Card expiry details using the following 3 ways:



a.  **At a date and time**: All the Cards will expire on this specific date irrespective of when different users received the Cards. After Card is sent, if a user has not opened the Inbox even once till this expiry date, then that user will never see this Card.



b.  **Days after the user has seen the Card**: You can define the number of days for which the Card would remain active in the Inbox after the user has seen a particular Card i.e. after the impression happened. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days.



c.  **Days after the Card has been delivered to Inbox**: You can define the number of days for which the Card would remain active in the Inbox after the Card has been delivered to the App Inbox. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days.



For example: As per the scheduling criteria set above, the Card campaign runs between 6th July and 30th September. And, the Card expiry is set as **60 days** after the Card is delivered to the user's Inbox.  Now, consider the scenario:



The Card is delivered to User 1 on 6th July. So, for User 1 this Card will remain active for 60 days from 6th July i.e. till 7th September, and expire on 8th September



The Card is delivered to User 2 on 15th August. So, for User 2 this Card will remain active for 60 days from 15th August i.e. till 15th October, and expire on 16th October.

| info | **Note**<br>The default value for Card expiry is 30 days after the Card is delivered to the user's Inbox. |





This option gives you the flexibility to decide whether, during the time the Card is active, should the user be able to see the Card 24/7 or only during certain hours on the active days. By default, it will be set to "Throughout the day"







For eg. If you want to run an online lucky draw every weekend at 5 PM for 1 hour and give out coupons to the winners then you might want to show the Card notification for this lucky draw between 4.55 PM and 6 PM.



![mceclip29.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360060849072)











This allows you to limit the maximum number of times a Card will be visible to the user. Let's assume that when a user clicks on a particular Card, it takes them to a product page with a 10% discount auto-applied. As a marketer, you want to limit each user to avail of this discount only 3 times. So, you can set up the value of maximum times to show the Card as 3. The Card will expire once the user has seen the Card 3 times.

| info | **Note**<br>This is an optional field. If no value is set, the Card will remain active until the expiry time. |













If you want a particular Card to get maximum user attention, then you can use the pin Card option. Select the **Pin Card to the top** option as follows:

![mceclip34.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360061008271)



A pinned Card will appear at the top of the Inbox with a pin icon as shown in the image below. Also, at any time only one Card be shown as pinned. So, if there are 2 Cards with the pin option enabled, then the latest Card will be shown as pinned.



![mceclip31.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360060850092)

3. Enable the **Conversion Goal** toggle to set your conversion goals for your Card campaign.

Conversion goals help you to track how your campaign helped you achieve your business metrics. You can choose any app event(for example, _Product Purchased_) as a conversion goal activity.

Let's assume that your conversion goal is to acquire customers to purchase an iPhone on your application. So, you enter the **Goal name** as _iPhonePurchase_ and the **Event name** as _Product Purchased_.
_![mceclip35.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360061008611)_

You can add attributes by clicking **\+ New attribute** associated with the event to specify your conversion goals. In this case, _prod\_name_ is the event attribute/property with the value _iPhone_ which means that your application will log the users who have purchased the product with name iPhone on your application.


### Multiple Conversion Goals


You can add up to **five** conversion goals by clicking the **\+ New goal** option. With multiple conversion goals, you can now track more than one business metric or can visualize a funnel for your user actions.

For example, you can use multiple conversion goals to check the following events for a Card campaign:


   - How many users have viewed the product page?

   - How many of them added that product to the cart?

   - How many of them made a successful order?


### Set Attribution Window

We also allow you to set an attribution window which is the duration for which you want to attribute the conversion goals to a specific campaign. This duration is calculated from the time at which the user received the campaign. By default, it is set for 36 hours but you can set it to any duration lesser than 36 hours.

![mceclip36.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/360060850672)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Note**<br>The conversion goals and their attribution window are optional fields. You can disable them anytime by switching off the toggle button next to conversion goals. |

4. Click **Launch** to confirm your campaign creation.

Upon successful campaign creation, you will be taken to the campaign info page where you can view the campaign performance stats and a brief campaign summary.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Note**<br>When the Card campaign is sent, it means the Card is ready to be delivered to the user. The Card will be delivered only when the user opens their app Inbox. |

Ensure to publish the campaign for users to access it in their app inbox.

### Content

Your MoEngage account has two different environments, Test and Live, with a single Workspace ID (available under **Settings** \> **Account** \> **General settings**) that is used as a MoEngage identifier.

The MoEngage SDKs (Android, iOS, and Web) direct the user data or event data to:

- The Test environment when the build is _DEBUG_
- The Live environment when the build is _RELEASE_

When you integrate an app or web for the first time or update it, you can test all new changes, such as event tracking, in the Test environment and update the app or release the web in the Live environment.

When you begin integrating any MoEngage SDKs, all your testing of user data or events data is visible in the Test environment. This enables you to test your integration and verify data before you go live or release your app or web.

You can switch between Live and Test environments by selecting the environment on the top navigation bar.

![live and test.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/23273680045844)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Information**<br>Apart from Team management, Billing, and your Profile settings, all other settings are separate for the Test and Live environments and available in the sidebar. |

## Test Environment

The following are the advantages of the Test environment:

- All team members added to the Test environment have all feature permissions in the Test environment. Everyone can experiment with different scenarios.
- All test data in the Test environment is processed and reflected faster, which saves time during initial integration and makes debugging easier.
- You can easily maintain and test different settings—Push FC, Event Trigger DND, Uninstalls—for Test and Live environments without any mutual impact.

## Live Environment

After you complete integration and decide to release your app or take your website live, mobile SDKs of MoEngage will detect the RELEASE build and send all live user data or event data to the Live environment.

The Live environment has feature restrictions for different access roles to prevent any mistakes or changes by any of your team members that can impact live user data and campaigns:

- Developers must specifically mark certain users as test users before they can create campaigns or run any segmentation queries in the Live environment. For more information, refer to [Test Users in LIVE Environment](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/210836083).
- Developers cannot change Push FC and DND settings in the Live environment.

If you face any issues, please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the Support team.

MoEngage allows you to secure your MoEngage account (workspace) with 2-step verification. To enable 2-step verification for your account, you must configure a one-time verification setup on your device using an authenticator app. After completing this one-time setup, the app on your device generates an authentication code. You can log in to your MoEngage account using the latest authentication code generated by your authenticator app.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| library\_add\_check | **Prerequisites**<br>You must have an authenticator app downloaded on your phone or device. MoEngage supports 2-step verification through apps such as Google Authenticator, Twilio Authy, etc. <br>- You can download the Google Authenticator from the following links:  - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_IN&gl=US)<br>  - [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)<br>- You can download Twilio Authy from the following links:<br>  <br>  - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy)<br>    <br>  - [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twilio-authy/id494168017) |

# Scenarios for Setting up 2-Step Verification on Your Device

The following are the scenarios for enabling 2-step verification on your device:

- When your Admin [signs up for MoEngage](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/33436161901332) or creates a new workspace, MoEngage enables 2-step verification by default to protect the workspace from unauthorized access. When your admin tries to log in, MoEngage prompts them to set up 2-step verification on their device.
- Your Admin invites you to join a workspace with 2-step verification enabled at the workspace level. When you finish [setting up your account](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/36906116607380), MoEngage prompts you to set up 2-step verification on your device.
- Your Admin has not enabled 2-step verification at the workspace level, and you have logged in to your account. You enable 2-step verification for your account [in **My profile**](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/36781211059476). You log out of your account or close the browser. During your next login, MoEngage prompts you to set up 2-step verification on your device.
- Your [Admin enables 2-step verification](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046714492) after you have logged in to your account, and you are automatically logged out. During your next login, MoEngage prompts you to set up 2-step verification on your device.

The scenarios above take you to the 2-Step Verification page:

# Troubleshoot Issues with 2-Step Verification

If you are facing challenges with 2-step verification, perform the following steps:

- The 2-step verification code is only valid for 30 seconds, so make sure that the device you are using to access MoEngage and the device where the authenticator is installed both have the same timezone.
- Clear the browser’s cookies and cache.
- Each MoEngage customer is hosted in a separate data center. When logging in, make sure you use the correct URL for your workspace. You can find the correct login URL by referring to the mapping of the workspace [here](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057030512-Data-Centers-in-MoEngage) and the API endpoints.
- If you do not receive the email to reset your authenticator device, ensure that your administrative team has not blocked the MoEngage domain.

If you still face challenges after performing the above steps, contact the MoEngage Support team.

For further assistance, please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the Support team.

### Content

Growth teams often perform their custom analysis on the users and user data. Post the analysis, growth teams would want to use these users in a campaign or perform further analysis.

These users can be uploaded to MoEngage and used as the File Segment. The File Segment is a list of users. File Segment can be used for MoEngage campaigns or Analytics.

File Segments provide flexibility to create and target user segments that you may have identified through some user analysis at your end. You can import a list of users containing one of the User Attributes that identifies a unique user, and a custom segment of these users gets created.

# Create a File Segment

Step 1:

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Segment > All Segments > +Segment > File Segment

![File_segment_1.gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/11204689831316)

Step 2:

1. Provide a Custom segment name and description.
2. Select the file which has the user list. You can either upload a CSV or provide a URL to the same.
3. Select the User Attribute that your list is using. For example, if you have a list of the Driving IDs of your users, select Driving ID from the user attribute dropdown.
4. Provide one or more email IDs where MoEngage can inform, once the custom segment is created.

**Note:** If you don't see the segment after receiving the email, please refresh the page and search.

| warning | A user attribute value must uniquely identify a single user. If an attribute value identifies multiple users (e.g. a city attribute with the value 'London' may have many users) these multiple users may get mapped to a single attribute, become part of the segment, and may block other users from being included in the segment.<br>For example, you upload 5 emails, and the first email matches with 3 users (A, B, and C), and the remaining 4 emails match with one user each (D, E, F, and G). In this case, the system will randomly pick 5 users to be added to the file segment.<br>The system does the processing in batches of 2,000 attribute values and add maximum of 2,000 users into file segment for each batch. Even with fewer user attribute values, more users could be added to the file segment. For example if 1500 user attribute values results into 2500 users, system will randomly add 2000 of these 2500 users into the file segment. |

## File Format

Please check your file before uploading it to MoEngage systems. Ensure that -

- The file does not have duplicate values,
- The file does not have special characters,
- The file does not have double quotes,
- The file does not have empty rows or empty columns
- It should be a CSV file with a single column containing the user attribute.
- The file size should not be more than 64 MB.

[Sample file link](https://app-cdn.moengage.com/assets/Sample_GAIDs.csv)

## Custom Segment Availability

As soon as the MoEngage system receives the File Segment request, it creates the custom segment. After creating a custom segment, the system processes the users and adds those users to the custom segment.

Hence custom segment is **available** when the file is processing and also if the file processing is failed. When the File Segment is processed, its status (either completed or failed) is communicated through an email.

In case the file upload/processing has failed, you can upload the file again using the same custom segment name. The system will add the new user to the provided custom segment. This functionality also enables adding new users to any existing file custom segment.

## Status and Warnings for File Segment Processing

To prevent issues arising from using file segments before they are fully processed, MoEngage provides warnings in the UI. These warnings help you understand if a segment is still being processed and when it's advisable to use it.

![Screenshot 2025-05-19 at 3.16.56 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37696486393364)

| --- | --- |
| info | **Information**<br>You will see these warnings on the following pages:<br>- Create segment page<br>- **Target audience** sections on all the campaign creation pages<br>- **Target audience** sections on analytics pages |

### Warnings During Segment Usage

When you select a file segment that is still being processed for use in creating another segment, while targeting a campaign, or in analytics, a warning message will be displayed. The warning is displayed based on the following conditions:

- **If a single selected segment is being processed**: "Users are being updated in this segment - < _Custom Segment name_ >. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use this segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update."
- **If segments nested in another segment are processing**: "Users are being updated in these segments - < _Custom Segment 1, Custom Segment 2, Custom Segment 3 names_ >. These segments are nested in the parent segment chosen. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use the segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update."

Refresh the page or choose the segment again to see its latest status. This warning will no longer appear after the last file in the queue is successfully processed.

### Warning in the Segment Detail Page

If you navigate to the detail page of a custom segment that is currently being updated (i.e., a file upload is still processing), a warning message will be displayed as follows: "Users are being updated in this segment - < _CS name linked_ >. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use this segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update."

Refresh the page to see the segment's latest status. This warning will no longer appear after the file processing is successfully completed.

## User Availability

File Segments can only have users that are present in MoEngage. If you upload a user, who is not present in MoEngage systems, that user is not processed and can not be part of the File Segment.

To upload new users into the MoEngage and create a File Segment of those users, refer to [Import Users](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/19192630201620-Import-User-Data-Using-CSV).

The total number of users uploaded via the File segment is limited to 2 million per day.

(This limit is customizable, please get in touch with support to increase the limits.)

# Edit a File Segment

Editing an existing file segment is possible via the MoEngage dashboard. On the MoEngage dashboard, you can perform the following actions on a file segment:

1. Add users: A new list of users can be added to an existing file segment.
2. Remove users: A list of users can be removed from an existing file segment.
3. Replace users: A list of users can be replaced in an existing file segment.

Step 1:

Navigate to the file segment that you would like to edit from the Segment > All Segments page.

Step 2:

From the Actions tab, click on the More Actions vertical ellipses and choose the Edit option.

Step 3:

1. Choose the Edit action that you want to perform on the file segment among Add users, Remove users and Replace users.
2. Select the file which has the user list to be added, removed, or replaced. You can either upload a CSV or provide a URL to the same.
3. Select the User Attribute that your list is using. For example, if you have a list of the Driving IDs of your users, select Driving ID from the user attribute dropdown.
4. Provide one or more email IDs where MoEngage can inform, once the custom segment is processed.

![File_segment_4.gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/11209317951892)

All functionalities of file segments: Create segments, Remove and Replace users from the File Segment can also be accessed using [File Segment API](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405027805844-Custom-File-Segment-API).

# Archive/Unarchive a File Segment

File Segments can be archived from the MoEngage dashboard.

1. File segments that have not run (query not executed) in the last 60 days are automatically archived.
2. All the users from the archived File Custom Segment are dropped after 30 days of archival. Hence after 30 days of archival, the archived custom segment returns 0 users.

# FAQs

arrow\_drop\_down **Why Does the User Count Differ Between the File Segment in MoEngage and the Uploaded File?**

### Problem

There is a discrepancy in the user count between the uploaded file and the file custom segment in MoEngage.

### Explanation

The following are the possible reasons for these differences:

- Zero count
  - **Wrong attribute provided:** The attribute selected during the file segment upload does not match the values provided in the file. For example, if the attribute selected is _age_ (double data type) but the file contains values for _name_ (string data type), there will be no matching users in MoEngage, resulting in a zero count.
  - **File not downloadable:** If the file URL provided is private or expired, MoEngage cannot download the file, leading to no users being added to the custom segment and a zero count.
  - **Inappropriate CSV content:** Issues such as leading or trailing spaces in values, rows with only spaces, non-UTF-8 characters, values enclosed in double quotes, or values ending with a comma can result in a zero user count.
  - **File processing delay:** After you upload a file, users will not be immediately added to the custom segment. Processing time increases with the number of values in the file. Querying the custom segment immediately after upload may result in a zero count.
- Less count
  - **Less users in MoEngage:** If the values mentioned in the file do not match those in MoEngage, they will not be considered, resulting in a lower user count.
  - **Inappropriate CSV content:** Similar to the zero count scenario, issues with CSV content can lead to a lower user count.
  - **File upload still processing:** A custom segment is created with zero users immediately after the file upload. Users are then added during the file processing. Querying the segment during processing may display a lower user count.
- More count
  - **Attribute value matches multiple users:** If the value provided in the file matches multiple users in MoEngage, all those matched users will be added to the custom segment, resulting in a higher user count.

For more information, read [File Segments](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/207606916-File-Segments).

arrow\_drop\_down **Why Does CSV Upload to File Segment Fail?**

### Problem

While uploading a CSV file in a file segment, the following error message appears:

There seems to be an error. We are working to fix this.

### Solution

Perform the following steps:

1. **Verify the File Format**:
   - Ensure the file is in the CSV format.
2. **Check the File Size**:
   - Confirm that the file size does not exceed 64 MB. If the file is larger than the allowed limit, reduce its size before uploading.
3. **Confirm the Unique Identifier Column**:
   - Ensure the file includes only one column designated as the segment's unique identifier.
   - It is recommended to use a unique identifier (UID).
4. **Remove Empty Rows and Junk Data**:
   - Check for empty rows at the end of the file.
   - Remove any unnecessary or duplicate values that might cause issues.
5. **Match Record Values to Attribute Data Types**:
   - Ensure the record values align with the specified data types.
6. **Avoid Unsupported characters**:
   - Remove any unsupported characters in the values. For example, special characters, double quotes (") are not supported.

For more information, read [File Segments](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/207606916-File-Segments).

arrow\_drop\_down **Why Does Third-Party Link Upload to File Segment Fail?**

### Problem

While uploading a third-party link in a file segment, the following error message appears:

There seems to be an error. We are working to fix this.

### Solution

Perform the following steps:

1. **Whitelist IPs for private files**:
   - If the file is private, whitelist the relevant IP addresses to grant access exclusively to MoEngage.
2. **Verify the file format**:
   - Ensure the file is in the CSV format.
3. **Check the file size**:
   - Confirm that the file size does not exceed 64 MB. If the file is larger than the allowed limit, reduce its size before uploading.
4. **Confirm the unique identifier column**:
   - The file must contain only one column that serves as the segment's unique identifier.
5. **Remove empty rows and junk data**:
   - Check for empty rows at the end of the file.
   - Remove any unnecessary or duplicate values that might cause issues.
6. **Match record values to attribute data types**:
   - Ensure the record values align with the specified data types.
7. **Avoid unsupported characters**:
   - Remove any unsupported characters in the values. For example, special characters, double quotes (") are not supported.

# Copy and Paste

The MoEngage canvas allows you to copy and paste flow stages and branches. Almost all of the flows created by marketers on MoEngage include multiple action campaigns on at least one channel. Although all the campaigns are different, most campaigns differ only slightly in content and most of the campaign configuration parameters remain the same. Allowing marketers to copy and paste flow branches and stages makes it easy for them to create their desired flows in a fast manner, thus saving time and effort.

Copy a StageCopy a Branch

1. To copy a stage, hover over the stage to be copied and click the copy icon  ![CopyIcon.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9110738988692) as shown below:

![CopyAction.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9110769870484)

When you click on the copy icon, the following message is displayed in the lower right corner of the canvas.

![PasteOption.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/9110761325844)
2. Hover over the place where you want to paste the stage and click on the '+' icon. You will see an app drawer where the name of the copied stage is displayed.

![pasting_Push1.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/31290014548756)
3. Click the stage name to paste it.

After you paste the copied flow stage, it appears with the name 'Copy - <FlowStageName>' as shown below. In the example below, the name of the flow stage that has been copied is 'Push1'. Thus, the name of the copied flow would be 'Copy - Push1'.

![PastedVersion.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/31289999010452)

# Introduction

Many new users visit websites daily but often leave after only a few minutes of browsing. To avoid losing potential customers and revenue, it is essential to collect their contact information before they exit.

#### Advantages of collecting leads from first-time users

- **Building a customer base**: By collecting leads, you can establish a database of potential customers, which is essential for future marketing campaigns and sales efforts.
- **Targeted marketing**: With a list of leads, you can personalize your marketing messages and tailor your offers to specific customer segments, increasing the chances of conversion.
- **Increased sales and revenue**: By nurturing relationships with early-stage prospects, you convert them into paying customers down the line. You can drive sales and increase your overall revenue by providing offers and discounts.
- **Improved customer understanding**: Lead capture helps you gain insights into your target audience, their needs, and preferences, which can inform product development and marketing strategies.
- **Staying ahead of the competition**: In today's competitive landscape, you need to actively seek out and engage with potential customers to stay ahead of the competition.

In this article, we will [create an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/23197378545300-Collect-Leads-from-First-Time-Users#h_01HS0358RQZ8HWG2B1H5C5P83R) to collect contact details from your first-time users.

# Expected Result

When users visit the website, they will see a pop-up message with a prompt to enter their phone number:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| library\_add\_check | **Prerequisites**<br>- Your website must be integrated with the MoEngage Web SDK. For more information, refer to the [Web SDK](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/categories/360006308092-Web-SDK).<br>- The [On-site Messaging](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061573232-Configure-and-Integrate-On-site-Messaging) channel must be configured. |

# Create an OSM Campaign

In this section, we will create a campaign to collect contact details from your first-time users.

## Step 1: Target Users

1. On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click **Engage**, and then click **Campaigns**.
2. On the All campaigns page, click **\+ Create campaign**.
3. Under **Inbound**, click **On-site**.

![Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 2.14.36 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236428822676)

You are taken to the first step, **Target users**, in defining your campaign.
4. Define your campaign with a name and tags.
5. In the **Target platforms** section, select **Web** and **Mobile Web**.

![Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 2.16.19 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236437283860)
6. In the **Trigger Criteria** section, click the **On Exit Intent** card. This will ensure that the campaign is displayed to your users when they attempt to leave the page. For more information on defining exit intent, refer to [Exit Intent Technology](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043881431).

![3.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/24714306332692)
7. In the **Select pages** section, you will define where you would want to display the campaign. Select **Specific pages** to display the campaign on specific pages of your website. Define the condition shown in the following example to display the campaign on the website's product pricing page.

![2025-01-08_11-54-13 (1).gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236428825108)

You can click **\+ Filter** to add more conditions and click **And** or **Or** to define the logic to be applied.
8. In the **Target audience** section, click **Filter users by**. Under **User property**, select the attribute _ID_ and define the condition _does not exist_. This will segment the first-time users.

![5.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/24714338292500)
9. Click **Next** to move to the second step, **Content**, where we will define the content for your campaign.

## Step 2: Content

1. On the **Prebuilt and saved templates** tab, use the search box to search with the keyword _lead_ to find the **Popup: Lead Gen** template.
2. Select the desired template from the **Templates** section. Alternatively, you can start from scratch and build your own template by selecting **Blank Popup Template** in the **Start from scratch** tab.

![2025-01-08_12-25-39 (1).gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236428826388)
3. After the template loads, you can edit it and define the OSM according to your requirements. Click the **+** icon on the left to add new elements to your campaign.

![Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 11.13.50 AM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236428827156)
4. To define the OSM, click the input box and then click the first icon to get the settings shown in the image below:

![2025-01-10_11-16-42 (1).gif](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236428828948)
5. Here, you can implement basic checks. Selecting the _Tel_ option from the **Type** list allows MoEngage to verify that users enter only their mobile numbers.
6. On the **Advanced** tab, you can select the attribute where you would like to store the input value to save it to the profile created at MoEngage. This will help you engage with them in the future.

![Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 12.48.38 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236437289492)
7. Click **Next** to move to the third step, **Schedule and goals**, where we will define your campaign's schedule and goals.

## Step 3: Schedule and Goals

1. In the **Send campaign** section, define when you want to start and end your OSM campaign.

![10.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/24714338329108)
2. In the **Conversion goals** section, add conversion goals that you like to track. For more information, refer to [Conversion Goals](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/14111506452372-Create-OSM-Pro-Campaign#01GTKG8723GHBCNNRY42PE5AZ4).
3. In the **Campaign priority** section, assign a priority to this campaign. For example, selecting **Critical** ensures that the users will always see the campaign even when there are other campaigns for which they are eligible.

![Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 1.45.20 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37236437290516)
4. In the **Global Delivery controls** section, turn the **Ignore global minimum delay** toggle on to override the defined minimum delay between any two campaigns defined in settings.
5. In the **Local Delivery controls** section, define the controls based on your requirements. For more information, refer to [Create OSM Pro Campaign](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/14111506452372).

![11.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/24714306394772)
6. Click **Publish**.

The campaign is now published. The submitted response is stored in the user attribute in the MoEngage user profile.

# Conclusion

In this use case, we created an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign to collect contact details from your first-time users.

Now that we have published the campaign, we can track our CTR and conversions (if defined) to understand its performance.

Accepted values - 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07,….., 23<br>00 stands for the period between 12 AM - 1 AM; 01 stands for the period between 1 AM - 2 AM and so on.<br>Example: For a time interval between 7 PM - 11 PM, the input for this field should be “ **19,20,21,22”** |
| USER\_IP\_ADDRESS | No | This field must contain the user’s IP address for evaluating geo-location-based experiences. |
| USER\_AGENT | No | This field must contain the USER-AGENT HTTP header. This is essential to deliver personalized content based on in-session attributes like Device Type. |

### User identification for fetching personalized content

The API processes the user identity information shared in the request and identifies the user to whom the communication needs to be sent, as shown below.

![Server-side.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/25935057151764)

Once all the necessary information is added to the request, send the request from the external console.

## Testing the request in Postman

To test in Postman, do the following:

1. Click on the **copy & open Postman** icon to copy the cURL and import it in Postman.
   - Add the authentication details by using the authorization section. Add the Workspace ID as the username and the API Key as the password.

   - The imported cURL will contain the payload details. Copy the experience key and update it in the respective field. Add the authorization header and other attributes.

   - Click on Send in Postman. This will send the request to the Fetch Personalize API.

# Introduction

As marketers, we use lightning deals, midnight deals, flash sales, product launches, event registrations, membership renewals, limited-time deals, and other time-bound offers to increase website/app traffic. Such campaigns often use countdown timers, which show how long they have to take action, to catch users' attention and create a fear of missing out (FOMO) emotion to nudge them towards purchasing.

#### Advantages of adding countdown timers in email campaigns

- **Boosting conversions**: The visible ticking clock prompts immediate action, making subscribers more likely to click through and purchase during a limited-time offer.
- **Increasing website/app traffic**: A countdown timer's visual element grabs attention and encourages interaction with the email.
- **Highlighting time-sensitive offers**: Perfect for flash sales, limited edition products, or upcoming events where a deadline is crucial.
- **Creating scarcity**: The perception of limited availability due to the countdown can motivate people to act faster.
- **Improving click-through rates**: Countdown timers often lead to higher click-through rates on email campaigns.

We will achieve this use case by creating a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website that displays a countdown timer for a sale. We will use the [On-site Messaging (OSM)](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/29145844762900-Display-a-Non-Intrusive-Countdown-Timer-Banner#h_01J4KNFBHY1DRDTH245YA896Y7) feature of MoEngage.

# Expected Result

Users will see a non-intrusive banner with a countdown timer at the top of the website, highlighting the remaining time for a sale. This will increase the sense of urgency and potentially boost sales during the promotional period.

![OSM 1.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29145856460692)

# Create an OSM Campaign

In this section, let's create an OSM campaign to show a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website.

## Step 1: Target Users

1. Navigate to the sidebar on the left, click **Engage** > **Campaigns,** and click **\+ Create campaign.**
2. Under **Inbound**, click **On-site**.

![Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 2.42.21 PM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/37239173502612)

You are taken to the first step, **Target users**, of defining your campaign.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Campaign name**: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, _Countdown Timer Banner_.
   - **Campaign tags**: Select the relevant campaign tags.
4. In the **Target platforms** section, select **Web**.
5. In the **Trigger criteria** section, select **On Page Load**.

   - Set the trigger to display the countdown banner when a user visits the website.
   - Ensure the banner is shown after the user has been on the website for at least 5 seconds to avoid being too intrusive.

     ![OSM 2.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29145856461204)
6. In the **Select pages** section, select **All pages**.

7. On the **Target audience** section, select **All users** to target all users who visit the website during the sale period.

8. Select the **Exclude Users** check box and define a condition to exclude users who have already made a purchase during the sale.

![osm 4.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29145856466324)
9. Click **Next** to move to the second step, **Content**, where you can define the content for your campaign.

## Step 2: Content

1. In the **Search templates** field, search with the keyword “countdown” to find a list of pop-up windows.
2. In the **Banner templates** section, hover over the **Banner: Countdown timer with button** template and click **Select Template**.

![OSM 5.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29145844758420)
3. Design the countdown timer banner in the desktop view as follows:
   - Add a title: _Hurry up! Sale ends in._

   - Style: Use a bold and attractive font to grab attention.

   - Include a countdown timer: Display the remaining time for the sale. Ensure the timer counts down in real time.

   - Add a call-to-action (CTA) button: _Shop Now_
     - Link **:** Direct the button to the sale page.

     - Style: Make the button stand out with a vibrant color and clear font.
   - Design the pop-up in the mobile view: Reduce the text size of the elements and hide any element, if required.

   - Ensure the banner is non-intrusive: Position the banner at the top of the website so it does not cover any content or disrupt the user experience. Select the **Push the content of the page down** check box to ensure the banner is non-intrusive.

4. Click **Next** to move to the third step, _Schedule and goals_, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.

## Step 3: Scheduling and goals

1. Set up campaign scheduling and delivery controls:
   - Determine the duration for which the campaign will run, aligning with the sale period.

   - Configure the banner to be shown only once per session to avoid repetitive prompts and enhance user experience.

   - Configure the frequency and limits to ensure the message is shown appropriately.

     ![OSM 7.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/29145844761108)
2. After all the settings are verified, click **Publish** to launch the campaign.


# User Interaction

- Targeted users will visit the website during the sale period.
- After 5 seconds, the non-intrusive banner with the countdown timer will appear at the top of the website.
- Users can click the CTA button to explore the sale items or ignore the banner if they are uninterested.

# Conclusion

In this use case, we created a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website that displays a countdown timer for a sale. We used the OSM feature of MoEngage.

By implementing this countdown timer banner, users are subtly informed about the limited-time sale, creating a sense of urgency that encourages them to make a purchase before the sale ends. This approach helps to increase user engagement and boost sales during the promotional period.

# Introduction

Brand Marketers transitioning from other platforms to MoEngage want to migrate their historical user-device data to the MoEngage platform to start leveraging the platform's capabilities to the fullest extent without any delay. As part of the transition process, the end-users of the brand need to upgrade to the new version of the brand-app which is integrated with MoEngage SDK. This typically involves a delay as the entire user-base of the brand slowly moves to the new version.

This article provides you with information on various methods that can assist you in seamlessly migrating the historical data of your users and their devices to MoEngage using server-to-server APIs. These methods simplify your migration journey, making it more convenient.

# Use Cases 

For a brand/business with a substantial user base, it takes time for all users to transition to the upgraded app version, delaying reaping the benefits of the platform. However, for users who have already installed the updated app version that includes the MoEngage SDK, it begins tracking their data immediately.

This gives rise to some scenarios, as mentioned below, and this article provides the solution for each scenario:

## Scenario 1:

Users who have not upgraded to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK cannot receive push notifications triggered from MoEngage platform.

## Solution: Push token migration using Track Device API

Because a substantial user-base have not yet upgraded to the latest app version, MoEngage SDK cannot yet track their user-device properties and events. Instead of waiting for the entire user base to update their apps to the version which is integrated with the MoEngage SDK, you can use the Track Device API to import Push tokens already available to you into MoEngage. Track Device API or Bulk Import API helps you to create/update devices of existing users.

Using [Track device API](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/31285296671252-Track-Device), you can seamlessly migrate the already available device information with you, such as Push token, GAID/ IDFV and platform information into MoEngage. MoEngage validates and accepts unique values of Push token, GAID/IDFV and platform of every device attached to the user.

Once above device information is ingested successfully into MoEngage, you can trigger Push campaigns from the MoEngage platform.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| info | **Information**<br>This method of Push notification delivery by migrating device attributes using Device API and sending push campaigns from the MoEngage platform is applicable only to iOS devices. Android devices with later versions of AndroidOS still require MoEngage SDK to render Push notifications. Further, such notifications will launch the app but will not be able to redirect to a specific page in the app, please frame the title, subtitle and message content of the push notification accordingly.<br>Although Push notifications will be delivered for iOS devices, corresponding campaign stats such as Push notification clicked will not be tracked as these events are tracked by MoEngage SDK which may not be integrated with the app version used by end-users during migration. |

## Scenario 2:

Nudge users to upgrade to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK by effectively targeting them.

## Solution: Migrate User Device Information Using Bulk Import API

As a marketer, you can create users and their devices using the [Bulk Import API](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413174113044-Bulk-Import) of MoEngage. You can then assign a custom user attribute with a corresponding value to indicate users who should be notified about the app version upgrade.

For example, consider the custom user attribute _bulk\_migration_ and its value to be set to _true_ for the users who have not upgraded to the latest app version. You can use this custom user attribute to create a segment, as explained below:

### Create a Segment

Perform the following steps to create a segment that contains the users who have not performed the app upgrade:

1. On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click **Segment** \> **Create segment**.
2. Click **Filter users by**, and then click the **User property** tab.
3. In the **Select attribute** list, select the custom user attribute you created to mark the migrated users. In this use case, the custom user attribute is _bulk\_migration_ set to _true_.

![Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 11.37.05 AM.png](https://help.moengage.com/hc/article_attachments/33542213711508)
4. Perform the remaining steps to create the segment. For more information, refer to [Create Segments](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/206169646).

After creating the segment, you can send campaigns to target the users in this segment and nudge them to upgrade to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK.
